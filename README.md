- 👋 Hi, I’m @PBWagner, an occasional developer based in Colorado.
- 👀 I’m interested in (mostly) what is now called Data Engineering, that is, getting data and making it useful.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Data Science, python and various packages, the Jupyter environment, and am looking at machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: TBD
- 📫 How to reach me: <nick> dot Wagner at shell dot com  (if you know me you know my nick)
